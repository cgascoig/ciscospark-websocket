# ciscospark-websocket

This module can be used to build a bot for Cisco Spark that only uses outbound connections - a websocket connection to receive notifications of events and REST API calls to the Spark service.

This is based on the NodeJS implementation [here](https://github.com/marchfederico/ciscospark-websocket-events). 

An example of how this can be used is included in `example-echobot.py`
